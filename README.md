# iOS Login App with Seague

This is an iOS login app which first identifies what kind of biometric device does your iPhone support.<br /><br />
If it supports Face ID then a face icon button is shown and when clicked it requires face id authentication.<br /><br />
Similarly if the iPhone supports Touch ID then it shows a fingerprint icon button and when clciked it askes for touch id authentication.<br /><br />
Once the user is Authenticated then the user is taken to another view with seague.
